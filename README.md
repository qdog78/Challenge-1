# Challenge 1
## The goal of this challenge was to clean up the websites attributes on a website that was already developed
The website was 90% functional but it was missing things that would make the website accessible to other developers, and those with disabilities. The elements of the site had a bunch of ".div" properties in the site that complicates the html properties. The images and icons within this website also lacked alt attributes.I added semantic HTML elements and I added alt attributes for people with disablities and to make the site easily found on google image searches.
